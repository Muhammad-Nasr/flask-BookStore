<p class="lead">BookStore is a webapp based on Python-Flask using Google books api, database.
          <br>
          I am using requests module and json to extract data from google books api.
          Book Store is a website for book readers. Reader can search for books by book name, author any common subject.
          Reader need to register to have his own account, Reader has a private page account and a table contains his bookshelf,
          so he can save his books and track you reading, edit, and delete.
          Reader's info is personal. every reader need a special username and password to access his account.
          Reader is free in any time to access his data.
          Reader data is saved the database.
          Every Reader is welcome, We appreciate your comments.
